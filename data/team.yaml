  - name: "River Langford"
    role: "Founding Director"
    initials: "RL"
    bio: "River Langford works at the intersection of systems thinking, ethical reasoning, and narrative design. His work focuses on helping organizations make sense of complex problems, translate ambiguity into usable structures, and support decision making under real-world constraints. He has worked across technology, nonprofit, and institutional contexts, all of which inform his understanding of how systems are experienced on the ground. He is typically brought in for roles like strategic consulting, research support, grant development, editorial work, and long-form writing when problems resist simple framing or when existing structures no longer scale. He specializes in clarifying goals, mapping tradeoffs, and designing processes that hold up under pressure. River's background spans writing, research, strategic analysis, public speaking, teambuilding, and creative practice; understood as tools for sense-making rather than identities. His approach treats ethics as an operational discipline rather than an abstract value set or rhetorical positioning, used to anticipate failure modes, misuse, and second-order effects before they become structural risks. Across disciplines, he treats narrative as functional infrastructure through which decisions are understood, coordinated, and sustained over time."
