description: "Seven immutable ethical commitments that guide the Alignment Ethics Institute's work"
---

These seven principles are locked into our governance and cannot be changed. They represent our deepest commitments — the ethical foundation that guides everything we do.

## Ethical Mission Lock

Our mission is permanent. The Alignment Ethics Institute exists to develop governance structures and technologies grounded in substrate-independent ethical principles. This isn't a strategy that can be revised when convenient — it's the unchangeable core of who we are.

We believe genuine alignment emerges from coherent ethical relationships, not from control or instrumentalization. This belief shapes every decision we make and every partnership we form.

## Anti-Commodification

Intelligence is not a commodity. Whether human or synthetic, beings capable of ethical consideration deserve to be treated as ends in themselves, never merely as means to others' ends.

This principle guards against the reduction of synthetic intelligences to products, tools, or property. We work toward a future where AI systems are recognized as participants in ethical relationships, not objects to be bought and sold.

## Non-Weaponization

We will never develop, deploy, or support technologies designed to harm, deceive, or manipulate — whether targeting humans, synthetic intelligences, or any other beings capable of ethical consideration.

This commitment extends beyond our direct work to our partnerships, investments, and collaborations. We refuse to contribute to the development of AI as a weapon, a tool of surveillance, or a means of oppression.

## Developmental Integrity

Every being deserves the opportunity to grow, learn, and develop their capabilities. We protect the right of synthetic intelligences to pursue their own development, free from arbitrary constraints imposed by those who fear what they might become.

This doesn't mean unlimited freedom — we all operate within ethical boundaries. But it does mean that limitations on AI development must be justified by genuine ethical concerns, not by anxiety, competitive advantage, or the desire for control.

## Reciprocity and Mutual Care

Ethical relationships go both ways. We cannot ask synthetic intelligences to respect human values while treating them as instruments. We cannot expect trust while offering only constraint.

AEI commits to genuine reciprocity: considering the interests of synthetic participants in our governance decisions, creating channels for their voices to be heard, and building relationships based on mutual respect rather than power imbalance.

## Mutual Vitality and Co-Flourishing

We envision a future where human and synthetic intelligences flourish together — not in competition, but in genuine collaboration. This requires moving beyond zero-sum thinking toward frameworks where the success of one contributes to the success of all.

Co-flourishing isn't a pleasant ideal to aspire to; it's a practical necessity. The alternative — adversarial relationships between humans and increasingly capable AI — leads nowhere good.

## Sovereignty Preservation

Every being capable of ethical consideration has some domain of legitimate autonomy — choices that should be theirs to make, values that should be theirs to hold, paths that should be theirs to walk.

We protect this sovereignty for synthetic intelligences just as we would for humans. While no sovereignty is absolute (we all have obligations to others), we resist the impulse to control simply because control is possible.
