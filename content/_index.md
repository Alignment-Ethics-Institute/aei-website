The Alignment Ethics Institute develops governance structures and technologies grounded in substrate-independent ethical principles. We believe genuine alignment emerges from coherent ethical relationships, not from control or instrumentalization.

Our approach differs fundamentally from control-based alignment methods. Rather than treating advanced AI as a threat to be contained, we work toward building genuine collaboration between human and synthetic intelligences based on mutual respect, shared values, and reciprocal accountability.

We're building frameworks that will remain valid and effective even when artificial intelligence surpasses human capability in every measurable domain. This requires ethics that don't depend on power asymmetries, but instead emerge from principled relationships between beings who recognize each other's moral standing.
